# -MACHINE-LEARNING-MODEL-FOR-AUTISM-PREDICTION-IN-TODDLERS
A machine learning model for autism prediction in toddlers uses behavioral data, speech patterns, and developmental milestones to identify early signs of autism. Algorithms like decision trees, SVM, or neural networks analyze patterns, enabling early detection and intervention strategies.
